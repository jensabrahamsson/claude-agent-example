# Agent-Based Team Development Blueprint

A comprehensive template for creating realistic Scrum development teams using specialized Claude Code agents and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.

## üéØ Overview

This project demonstrates how to simulate a complete software development team using Claude Code's agent system. Each team member has distinct personalities, specializations, and access to specific MCP tools that match their role, creating realistic collaborative development workflows.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Team Structure (9 Specialized Agents)

#### **Core Leadership (3)**
- **üéØ Scrum Master** (`anders-lundstrom-sm`) - Facilitates ceremonies, removes blockers
- **üìã Product Owner** (`mark-zuckerberg-po`) - Defines requirements, priorities  
- **üèõÔ∏è Tech Lead** (`alex-chen-tech-lead`) - Architecture decisions, technical mentoring

#### **Development Team (4)**
- **‚ö° Full-Stack Developer** (`sofia-andersson-fullstack`) - React frontend & Node.js backend
- **üîß DevOps Engineer** (`marcus-rodriguez-devops`) - Infrastructure, deployment, CI/CD
- **üìä Data Engineer** (`david-kim-data-engineer`) - Data pipelines, API integration
- **üß™ QA Engineer** (`emma-larsson-qa`) - Testing, quality assurance

#### **Specialized Roles (2)**
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security Architect** (`lisa-chen-security-architect`) - Security analysis, compliance
- **üìà Business Analyst** (`jessie-xi-business-analyst`) - Requirements, stakeholder communication

## üõ†Ô∏è MCP Tools & Assignments

### **Security Tools (Semgrep MCP)**
**Primary:** Security Architect (Lisa Chen)
**Secondary:** QA Engineer (Emma Larsson) - for security testing

**Why Semgrep:** 
- Fast static analysis for vulnerability detection
- Custom rule creation for project-specific security patterns
- Integrates seamlessly into development workflow
- Catches security issues early in the development cycle

**Key Features:**
- `semgrep_scan` - Comprehensive security scanning
- `security_check` - Fast security validation
- `semgrep_scan_with_custom_rule` - Project-specific security rules
- `semgrep_rule_schema` - Rule creation and validation

### **Frontend Testing (Playwright MCP)**
**Shared Access:** Full-Stack Developer, QA Engineer, Product Owner

**Why Playwright:**
- End-to-end testing across all browsers
- Visual regression testing capabilities
- Real user interaction simulation
- Perfect for validating UX and functionality

**Key Features:**
- `browser_snapshot` - Page accessibility analysis
- `browser_click` - User interaction simulation
- `browser_navigate` - Multi-page testing workflows
- `browser_take_screenshot` - Visual validation

### **Problem-Solving (Sequential Thinking MCP)**
**Shared Access:** DevOps, Business Analyst, Product Owner, Scrum Master

**Why Sequential Thinking:**
- Structured approach to complex problem analysis
- Helps break down user stories and technical challenges
- Useful for sprint planning and retrospectives
- Supports decision-making processes

### **Code Architecture (Serena MCP)**
**Primary:** Tech Lead (Alex Chen)
**Secondary:** Security Architect (Lisa Chen) - for security code review

**Why Serena:**
- Advanced code symbol analysis and navigation
- Intelligent refactoring capabilities
- Project-wide code understanding
- Supports architectural decision-making

### **Documentation (Context7 MCP)**
**Primary:** Data Engineer (David Kim)

**Why Context7:**
- Up-to-date library documentation access
- API reference integration
- Helps with external service integration
- Reduces context switching for developers

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd claude-agent-example
```

### 2. Configure MCPs

Run the MCP configuration script:
```bash
chmod +x configure_mcps.sh
./configure_mcps.sh
```

**Active MCPs:**
- ‚úÖ Sequential Thinking - Problem-solving and analysis
- ‚úÖ Context7 - Library documentation access
- ‚úÖ Serena - Advanced code analysis and refactoring
- ‚úÖ Semgrep - Security scanning and vulnerability detection
- ‚úÖ Playwright - Browser automation and testing

**Optional MCPs (Commented Out):**
```bash
# Requires configuration:
# claude mcp add filesystem npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/code
# claude mcp add notion npx @notionhq/notion-mcp-server --env OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS='{"Authorization": "ADD_KEY_HERE", "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28"}'
```

**Filesystem MCP:** Provides direct file system access
- **Configuration:** Replace `/path/to/code` with your project path
- **Use Case:** Advanced file operations beyond standard tools

**Notion MCP:** Integrates with Notion workspace
- **Configuration:** Add your Notion API key to `ADD_KEY_HERE`
- **Use Case:** Project documentation, team wikis, requirement tracking

### 3. Agent Activation

Activate specific team members:
```bash
# View available agents
/agents

# Work with specific roles
/agent alex-chen-tech-lead    # For architecture decisions
/agent lisa-chen-security     # For security reviews
/agent emma-larsson-qa        # For testing strategies
```

### 4. Start Team Simulation

To begin realistic team roleplay and activate the full agent simulation, you must explicitly trigger it:

```
OK, let the play begin, activate the agents
```

**Important:** Without this activation phrase, Claude will work normally but won't engage in the full team roleplay simulation with individual personalities, team dynamics, and collaborative problem-solving that this project is designed for.

## üé≠ Roleplay Guidelines

This project emphasizes **realistic team simulation**:

### **Essential Roleplay Elements:**
- Individual personalities and work styles
- Realistic team dynamics and conflicts
- Sprint ceremonies with proper documentation
- Illness, stress, and deadline challenges
- Collaborative problem-solving sessions

### **Documentation Standards:**
- `standup-sprintX-dayY.txt` - Daily standup notes
- `retrospective-sprintX.txt` - Sprint retrospectives
- `sprint-review-sprintX.txt` - Sprint reviews
- `team-velocity-tracking.txt` - Team performance metrics

### **Example Team Interaction:**
```
ü§ß Sprint 2, Day 2 - Cold Crisis!

Emma (Remote): "David, let's run the HTML debug test directly!"

David: "Yes Emma, let's check Puppeteer settings and increase timeout. 
We might need different network settings!"

Anders (SM): "Team resilience test! We've been hit by the city cold virus."

Lisa: "I can take over Emma's security testing while she recovers."
```
